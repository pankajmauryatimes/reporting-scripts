Students seek Taekwondo training, at least initially, in order to satisfy a need to either learn a form of un-armed fighting or to satisfy a need to develop themselves physically and or spiritually. It is the Taekwondo instructor's duty to satisfy these needs, and in the process of developing one need, develop the others. This is not done to force change on the student based solely on what the instructor believes to be the right thing to do, but it is done to maintain the universal balance of all things. The instructor cultivates both the Um and the Yang of his students in order to build the better person, to provide the necessary balance as divined by the philosophy of the Taeguk.It is with this philosophy in mind that the Taekwondo instructor carries out his duties, for at the heart of it, the Taekwondo instructor's duty is to build a better person who in turn creates a better society for everyone. This article was written to explain to the reader both the how and why I believe these three elements represent the core of the Taekwondo instructor's duty. By examining each of the elements in turn, it is hoped that the reader will gain a better understanding of what each of them means to the instructor and the student and how that portion of the training helps to build the better person."
